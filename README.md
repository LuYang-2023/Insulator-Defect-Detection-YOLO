# A Lightweight Insulator Defect Detection Model Based on Drone Images

## Introduction
This is our PyTorch implementation of the paper "[`A Lightweight Insulator Defect Detection Model Based on Drone Images`](https://doi.org/10.3390/drones8090431)" published in ***Drones***.


## 1.IDD-YOLO architecture diagram
The structural diagram of the IDD-YOLO target detection model will be published after the acceptance of the paper.

## 2.LCSA attention mechanism
The structural diagram and rationale of the LCSA attention mechanism will be published after the acceptance of the paper.

## 3.Dataset
My dataset contains sensitive information from the Tianjin Power Grid Company, and I need to communicate with them first to confirm whether this data can be made public.
